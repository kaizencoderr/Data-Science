# Data-Science Experience

##This repo contains projects and assignments from my Data Science courses.

Files associated with the topics discussed below can be found in the corresponding path within this repo.

Path: Data Science/Data Science Principles/
-This folder contains assignments from some of my fundamental data science courses.  Topics include data cleaning/preprocessing, pandas, SQL, Regex, data visualization tools, linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, loss functions (optimization of loss functions), bias variance tradeoff, feature engineering, principle component analysis, cross validation, regularization and gradient descent.

Path: Data Science/Machine Learning + Data Mining/
-This folder contains assignments in more advanced courses exploring machine learning in much more depth.  Topics include neural networks, sentiment analysis, dimensionality reduction, support vector machines, decision trees, clustering, ensemble methods, boosting, nearest neighbors, cross validation, and error metrics.
