There are indeed a few gaps in the high 90's scores which I suspect may be due to certain observations from the inspection that reduce the score by an amount more than 1; hence the gaps.  Furthermore, we see that the graph is skewed left with a tail, while the majority of inspections score above 90.  Overall, this graphs shows that most scores are rather high and so a score below 70 is quite concerning."

In addition, the high scores were less likely to improve on their scores by looking at the graph.  This makes sense because if they already had a high score to begin with there is not much room left for improvement."
